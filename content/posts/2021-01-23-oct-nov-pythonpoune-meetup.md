I have been part of the PythonPune organizing team since
May 2019. Organizing and attending PythonPune meetups always excite me
because I get to learn something new and meet new people. Due to the
COVID-19 pandemic situation, we moved meetups to virtual events since
March'20, keeping the same level of excitement. The PythonPune team
always prefers Free/Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS) for
everything. We use the Jitsi Meet platform for speakers and hosts, and
live stream it on YouTube channel to reach our audience. Sometimes
when streaming from Jitsi Meet is not possible, then we take help of
OBS Studio for live streaming.

## October 2020 meetup
Planning for every meetup starts a month before, that includes
selecting talks, announcing events, notifying people in advance and
more. Bhavin kickstarted October meetup with demonstration of the
git-cu tool from community newsletter. Git-cu is an interesting tool
that keeps local Git repositories organized by cloning them into a
directory structure based on their URL.

The first talk of October'20 meetup was "What's new in Python 3.9" and
it was delivered by Amol Kahat. He shed light on new features in
Python 3.9. The talk began with an installation of Python 3.9 on the
system. He described two ways of installation that are, by cloning
CPython source and by downloading the tarball from python.org site. He
also demonstrated his Python 3.9 environment. I learnt new remove
prefix and remove suffix methods of string, new union operator added
to the Python dictionary, decorate function with dictionary
pairs. Python 3.9 supports the IANA time zone database in the standard
library. There were questions about new union operator and adoption of
Python3.9 by web frameworks.

The next talk was by me on "Understanding Python's super()
function". The talk was pretty simple but as I explored super()
in-depth, I wanted to explain super() in detail and how it works for
multiple inheritances. I explained the proxy object returned by
super(), Method Resolution Order (MRO) and benefits of super(). Before
the talk ends, I gave practical advice on usage of super(), for
example, the caller and callee need to have a matching argument
signature etc.

## November 2020 meetup
The meetup began with one interesting tool from the November month's
newsletter by Chandan. He presented us with a pip-chill package that
is a nice way of generating requirements files for any Python project
with a minimum number of dependency packages as compared to the "pip
freeze".

Another talk of the November meetup was second in the series of design
patterns by A.P. Rajshekhar. He explained structural design patterns
taking examples of Facade and Proxy patterns. Facade pattern was well
understood when taken as an example of a user profile that wraps the
complicated subsystem and provides a simpler interface for clients. He
also gave a tour of protective proxy design patterns with its intent,
common usage and implementation. That was indeed an insightful
talk. A.P. Rajshekhar is planning to give the next talk about
behaviour patterns in a future meetup.

## Chit-chat session
Since we moved to virtual meetup, we were missing the discussions with
other fellow PythonPune members. That's why we came up with the idea
of a hangout call. This room is open to all chit-chat where everyone
joins the Jitsi Meet call after talks are done. This is an opportunity
for our audience to talk with the speakers and PythonPune team
directly.

PythonPune group has completed 6 years of continuous meetups this
December and still counting many more years ahead. To be part of this
journey, you can visit pythonpune.in and join the group.

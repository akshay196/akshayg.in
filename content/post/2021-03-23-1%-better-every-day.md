My notes of [1% Better Every Day - James Clear at ConvertKit Craft + Commerce 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNeXuCYiE0U) talk.

## The aggregation of marginal gains.

  To explain this, speaker talks about bicycle group example that work
  on small improvement to achieve an goal.
  
  Improve 1% each day that compound to end up 37% times better at end
  of year.
  
  Habits are compound interest of self-improvement.
  
## Framework of building good habits.

  4 stages of habit formation:

   - **noticing**

     implementation intention

     > Many people think that they lack motivation when they really lack is clarity.

     failure premortem

   - **wanting**

     driver of your habits is your physical environment
     Don't rely on self-power and self-control

   - **doing**

     quantity vs quality
     2 minute rule
     Optimize for the starting line, not the finish line

   - **liking**

     repeat behaviours because we like them
     The Seinfeld Strategy. (Don't break the chain)
     Never miss twice

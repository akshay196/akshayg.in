Copy slice to another slice:

```go
evens := []int{2, 4}
odds := []int{3, 5, 7}

N := copy(evens, odds)
fmt.Printf("%d element(s) are copied.\n", N)

// evens after copy is, [3, 5]
// odds is intact after copy, [3, 5, 7]
```

`copy` can be used over `append` if want to keep length of target
slice intact. If the source slice is bigger in size than destination,
`copy` only copies slice elements that occupies in target slice.

`append` can be used (like an example below) instead of `copy` if we
are unknown about the size of target slice and want to copy whole
slice to it:

```go
nums := []int{1, 2, 3}

nums := append(nums[:0], []int{4, 5, 6}...)

// nums is [1, 2, 3]
```
